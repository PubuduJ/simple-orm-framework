### A simple objectâ€“relational mapping framework

This is a simple framework that creates a relational database system and 
maps a given classes inside packages into database tables.

#### The mapping of classes to database tables is as follows,

- The @Table annotation must be used over the class name to create the database table. The name of the database table is the class name.
- The @PrimaryKey annotation must be used over the one field in the class to create the table's primary key.
- The column names of the database tables are matched to the field names of the class.
- Database tables can be created with both instance and static variables.

#### Supported data types in the framework,
- String -> VARCHAR(256)
- int -> INT
- Integer -> INT
- double -> DOUBLE(10,2)
- Double -> DOUBLE(10,2)
- BigDecimal -> DECIMAL(10,2)
- Date -> DATE
- Time -> TIME

The goal of this project was to improve the knowledge of java annotations and java reflection API.
